# Python-Fuzzy-Logic
Material related to fuzzy logic
I am interested in fuzzy logic concept maps. Mental Modeler is one of the programs that may be used to make such maps. PyFCM is a Python program that can be used to compute various interpretations of Mental Modeler maps.
I have had problems with running PyFCM. There seem to be bugs in the program or else I am not running it in the correct way. I have tried to run it in repl.it and in PyCharm but have not succeeded so far.
I shall now try to search for bugs in the program and debug it in case I find bugs.
